HBnB is a comprehensive web application that combines various components such as database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing, all designed to replicate the functionalities of AirBnB. This marks the initial stage in the development of a complete web application, specifically an AirBnB clone. During this first step, the focus lies on creating a unique command-line interface that allows efficient management of data, along with the foundational classes required to store this data.
